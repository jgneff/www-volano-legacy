<h2>Server Features</h2>

<p>The VOLANO chat server is written in pure Java so that it can run

server has the following features:</p>

to the chat server at the same time.</dd>

sites, or domain names through which users can connect to a single VOLANO
chat server using its built-in Java applets.</dd>

<dt>Public chat rooms</dt>

using the VolanoChat applet.</dd>

can be entered only through the Web page on which they're defined.</dd>

Web page through which they are connecting, or use external DNS-based
blacklists to restrict access by IP address.</dd>

<dd>Restrict access by member names and passwords in any external database
or directory through the use of simple CGI scripts or servlets written
in any language, such as PHP, Python, Perl, or Java. Restrict access to
the chat server by members only, or allow both members and non-members

built-in and tunable flood control.</dd>
