<p><span class="c000">CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT. YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT BY INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE ON YOUR SYSTEM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS LICENSE, RETURN THE SOFTWARE TO US AND REMOVE IT FROM YOUR SYSTEM.</span></p>
<h2 class="section" id="sec1">License Grant</h2>
<p>“You” means the person or company who is being licensed to use the Software or Documentation. “We,” “us,” and “our” each mean the business referred to as “Status Six Communications.”</p>
<p>“Server Software” means the <span class="c000">VOLANO</span> chat server computer programs and their associated files.</p>
<p>“Client Software” means the VolanoChat, MyVolanoChat, and WebVolanoChat Java applet computer programs and their associated files.</p>
<p>“Software” means both the Server Software and the Client Software, and includes any upgrades, modified versions, updates, additions, and copies of the Software.</p>
<p>“Documentation” means explanatory written materials we provide regarding the Software.</p>
<p>“Code Base” means the host names or domain names from which the Client Software is distributed and where the Server Software is in use.</p>
<p>“Document Base” means the host names or domain names of the Web pages containing and embedding the Client Software.</p>
<p>We hereby grant you a nonexclusive license to use one copy of the Server Software on any single computer, provided the Server Software may be in use on only one computer at any time. The Server Software is “in use” on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (RAM) or installed into the permanent memory of a computer—for example, a hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device.</p>
<p>We hereby grant you a nonexclusive license to distribute an unlimited number of copies of the Client Software via the HTTP protocol or similar World Wide Web distribution methods onto your own or other Web pages, for use in connecting to the Server Software licensed to you under this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Software we build for you restricts the Code Base to the specific host name or domain name you provide and prevents someone from re-deploying the Client Software from another Web site for malicious purposes. The trial version of the Software restricts the Code Base to the local host (<em>localhost</em>, <em>ip6-localhost</em>). We may also restrict the Document Base to a list of host names or domain names you provide so that the Client Software is accessed only on known Web sites authorized by you.</p>
